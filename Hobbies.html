		<h1>Hobbies</h1>
		
			<p>I enjoy hunting and playing video games, my favorite video game is probably GTA 5 online. I like
			swimming and building new things. I work with wood sometimes to sculpt stuff, as in for fun and a joke
			I made a spanker for my friends if they ever disobeyed me in any way.
