				<h1>Hobbies</h1>
		
			<p>I enjoy hunting and playing video games, my favorite video game is probably GTA 5 online. I like
			swimming and building new things. I work with wood sometimes to sculpt stuff, as in for fun and a joke
			I made a spanker for my friends if they ever disobeyed me in any way.

			<h1>About My Life</h1>
				<p>I grew up in McClure Ohio I have lived there all of my life and I have 
				been to four different schools. The schools being, St Paul Napoleon, Napoleon 
				Area schools, Four County Career Center, and Patrick Henry High school. My favorite of them
				so far is probably Four County because I can learn stuff that actually interests me in life. 
				I am 17 years old and I was born on 2003. I just recently celebrated
				my birthday on August 14th.</p>
				<p> I would like to become a programmer because it interests me to be able to create things out of
				nothing I've always been pretty imaginative since I was little so being able to bring it to life would be 
				awesome, even just doing stuff for a company or any kind of programming interests me because 
				one you get really good money and two because I seriously think it would be fun to do that, creating
				this website was actually pretty interesting and I understood a lot of it after the video and I would
				enjoy doing more like this I feel like this class is perfect for me i'm a student of Mr. Geigers classroom. 
				My family always was telling me that being a programmer would pass because every little kid wants to be a game programmer when they are
				young but I still feel like it would be awesome so thats the path im pursueing I am really good with
				computers and most technology and I try to learn as much as I can about technology I want to be 
				able to eventually learn to build computers and know how ever piece works and understand technology.</p>
